## Ionic Angular Chat Application

This is a chat application developed using Angular and Ionic with Flask being used as the backend
The backend is separate and interacts with the front end using JSON. I will try to host the backend on Heroku.
Right now sockets have not been used as they are not supported on the previous hosting platform, PythonAnywhere.
The front end is built using Ionic and Angular and thus the same source code can be used for Android, iOS and Web.
The final compiled web version will be demoed on Github Pages.

The backend code is stored in chat-backend.

Build instructions to follow soon.
